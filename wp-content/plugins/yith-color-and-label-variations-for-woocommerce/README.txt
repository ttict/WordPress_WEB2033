YITH WooCommerce Color and Label Variations replaces the dropdown select of your variable products with Colors and Labels

== Description ==

With a quick look you can immediately see which variations of your products are available. Your favourite colour? Your size? You can spot it immediately without having to open the dropdown menu as it happens by default in WooCommerce.
Also, do you think that a color swatch would not be enough to give an idea of the product variation? No problem, you can upload a custom image for every swatch and none of your customers will never ever confuse one variation with another!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible.
If you are using the premium version of the plugin, we invite you ask for assistance in our support desk.

= How many attributes can I use for each product ? =

There’s no limit in the amount of attributes you may use. You can create many variations for each product using the configured attributes.

= My users found some issues when selecting attributes on products. They cannot switch from one attribute to the other of the same type. =

This is a known issue, which does not depend on a malfunctioning, though,, but on the fact that WooCommerce requires the chosen attribute to be deselected before another of the same type could be selected.
